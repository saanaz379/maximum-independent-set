    "# Introduction to GreedyMIS\n",
    "The GreedyMIS algorithm is a heuristic strategy for solving the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem by decomposing a graph into smaller subgraphs and solving each part either classically or using a QPU. Results for subgraphs are then aggregated for the final solution in the original graph. This approach is particularly valuable for two reasons:\n",
    "- it supports parallelization, if you have access to several quantum devices or to a single device that can perform several distinct computations concurrently;\n",
    "- it can be used to tailor the graph to hardware-constrained systems such as Rydberg atom arrays, where only specific subgraphs (e.g., unit-disk graphs) can be embedded and solved natively.\\n\",\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How Subgraphs Are Created**: Subgraphs are generated by greedily mapping the original graph onto a physical layout. Starting from different nodes, the algorithm assigns graph nodes to layout positions while preserving adjacency. This produces small, embeddable subgraphs used for solving MIS locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How Results Are Aggregated**: The global MIS is built by combining independent subgraph solutions. After each subgraph MIS is selected, it is added to the global solution, and its nodes and neighbors are removed. The best solution maximizes total size of the global MIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- Decomposes large graphs into smaller, embeddable subgraphs — especially useful when the full graph is too large to be solved directly on a QPU.\n",
    "- While not guaranteed to be optimal, GreedyMIS often yields high-quality solutions faster than exact algorithms.\n",
    "- Supports both classical and quantum solvers, allowing hybrid strategies that exploit quantum resources efficiently.\n",
    "- Offers control through parameters like `default_solving_threshold`, `subgraph_quantity`, and `mis_sample_quantity` to fine-tune trade-offs between speed and solution quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "As of this writing, the package has been tested with _unweighted_ graphs. Adding full-fledged functionality for weighted graphs is in progress."
