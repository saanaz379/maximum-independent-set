    "The Weighted Maximum Independent Set problem (WMIS) is a variant of MIS in which some nodes are given priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as MIS, there is currently no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve WMIS for general graphs on classical (non-quantum) devices. Consequently, in practice, finding an exact solution for large graphs is generally not possible due to time and hardware limitations. For this reason, most applications of WMIS must satisfy themselves with finding approximate solutions. As it turns out, in some cases, even finding approximate solutions is considered hard. For these reasons, there is high interest in solving WMIS on Quantum Devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This library does just that: compile a WMIS into a form suited for execution on quantum hardware. However, by opposition to MIS, as of this writing, Quantum Devices that can execute a compiled WMIS remain experimental and generally not available outside of research laboratories.\n",
